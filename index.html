    <section id="about">
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Our Synthetic Data Generation Framework uses advanced generative models 
            such as CTGAN, TVAE, and Gaussian Copula to create realistic datasets 
            while ensuring strong privacy protection.  
            This helps organizations use data safely for machine learning, analytics 
            and research without exposing sensitive information.
